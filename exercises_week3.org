** DONE Exercise 5.3
/Consider SHA-512-n, a hash function that first runs SHA-512 and then outputs only the first  bits of the result. 
Write a program that uses a birthday attack to find and output a collision on SHA-512-n, where n is a multiple of 8 between 8 and 48. 
Your program may use an existing cryptography library. 
Time how long your program takes when n is 16, averaged over five runs for each  How long would you expect your program to take for SHA-512-256? For SHA-512?/
** IN-PROGRESS Exercise 5.4
/Let SHA-512-n be as in the previous exercise. 
Write a program that finds a message M that hashes to the following value under SHA-512-16 (in hex): 3D 4B. 
How many tries would you expect the algorithm to need? 
Running the algorithm 5 times, how many tries did it take on average?/
